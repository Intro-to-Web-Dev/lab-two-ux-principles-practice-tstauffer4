        <h3>Usability</h3>
        <p>
            I used the site Pingdom to test the website's speed. Two suggestions Pingdom had to improve speed was to avoid URL redirects and use cookie-free domains. Both of these cause unnecessary network traffic and delays. 
        </p>
        <h3>Accessability</h3>
        <p>
        I used the Ace Web Accessability site to test the zoo's website accessability. Two suggestions Ace had to improve accessability was to include a H1 title for every page and use consistent hierarchy for titles. The H1 title will provide information to screen readers for blind users.
